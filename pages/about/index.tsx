  `years later, it only makes sense to pay homage to the expression I once knew and bring this metaphor to life. machi market is a vibrant bazaar of creativity, disguised as a digital marketplace offering streetwear, posters, collectibles, and more. it mirrors the world around us through a new lens, augmented by the memories of our childhood. my goal is to create a sense of community where people from all backgrounds can come together and connect through art and culture.`,
  `since the day i first picked up a pencil, it's been my passion to bring my visions to life. and with each passing day, i am building towards a future where the sketches in my notebook manifest into a machi market of my own, effortlessly connecting the past, present & future.`,
